## What is Armbian Linux? ##


# Simple

BASH shell, standard Debian utilities. General and specifics features are configurable with minimalistic menu-driven utility. Login is possible via serial, HDMI or SSH. 

# Light

No bloatware or spyware. Special utilities only when there are no other ways. Suitable for newcomers and professionals. 

# Optimized

A system is reduced to real data size and starts at around 1G. Size is optimized for SD card usage. Bigger is better. Installing applications later severely reduce the life of your SD card. They were not designed for this type of usage.

# Fast

Boards are optimized on kernel and userspace level. DVFS optimization, memory log caching, browser profile memory caching, swap usage tuning, garbage commit delay. Our system runs almost read-only and its the fastest Linux for development boards in just about every case.

# Secure

Security level is on a stock Debian level and can be hardened with the configuration utility. It provides a good starting point for industrial or home usage. A system is regularly inspected by professionals within a community. Each build is thoroughly tested. Images are a direct base for all 3rd party builders.

# Supported

Providing long term updates, security fixes, documentation, user support.

# Smart

Deep understanding how boards work, how operating system work and how hardware should be designed to run better. Involved in board design. Experience in Linux since early 90'. Specialized in ARM development boards since 2013. 

# Open

Opensource build script and kernel development, maintainace and distribution for more than [30 different ARM and ARM64 Linux kernels](https://www.armbian.com/kernel). Powerful build and software development tools. Can run in fully parallel mode. Can run under Docker.
