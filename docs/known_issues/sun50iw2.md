**All currently available OS images for H5 boards are experimental**

- don't use them for anything productive but just to give contructive feedback to developers
- `shutdown` might result in reboots instead or board doesn't really power off (cut power physically)
- for NEO2 to use correct device tree settings please [look here](https://github.com/armbian/build/issues/673)
