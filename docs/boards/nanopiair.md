- images [can be flashed directly to eMMC and accessed to it's serial console](http://forum.armbian.com/index.php/topic/1580-nanopi-neo-air/page-9#entry17707) trough the one and only soldered USB port.
- images are in preview / beta state. [Feedback is welcome](http://forum.armbian.com/index.php/topic/1580-nanopi-neo-air)! Those images might not be simple upgradable. For experts only.
- to get Wi-Fi working use 'sudo nmtui'. Please note that the Air has no aerial so you need to attach an antenna to the u.FL connector!
- Known issues with legacy images / testing needed: audio out in all variants
