- [PWM ready](https://github.com/dwilkins/pwm-sunxi) on pin PB2 (legacy)
- bluetooth working with on-board device. Enabled by default on both kernels.
- total memory is 2000Mb (disabled all memory reservations for GPU on CLI images)
- due to bad PCB placement, there is [some crosstalk between Wifi and VGA in certain videomodes](http://linux-sunxi.org/Cubietruck#VGA)
- make sure you power the board via power connector otherwise your USB port wonâ€™t be powered
- EDID detect video mode will fail on 4k monitor - you need to [set it manually](http://docs.armbian.com/Hardware_Allwinner/#how-to-reconfigure-video-output).
- Our OS images are only for A20 based Cubietruck and do not work on H8 based so called [Cubietruck Plus](http://linux-sunxi.org/Cubietech_Cubietruck_Plus) (we don't support CT+ anytime soon due too some design flaws like no real SATA and thermal problems)
