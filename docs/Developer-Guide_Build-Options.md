- **KERNEL_ONLY** (yes&#124;no):
    - leave empty to display selection dialog each time
    - set to "yes" to compile only kernel, u-boot and other packages for installing on existing Armbian system
    - set to "no" to build complete OS image for writing to SD card
- **KERNEL_CONFIGURE** (yes&#124;no):
    - set to "yes" to configure kernel (add or remove modules or features). Kernel configuration menu will be brought up before compilation
    - set to "no" to compile kernel without changing default or custom provided configuration
- **CLEAN_LEVEL** (comma-separated list): defines what should be cleaned. Default value is `"make,debs"` - clean sources and remove all packages. Changing this option can be useful when rebuilding images or building more than one image
    - "make" = execute `make clean` for selected kernel and u-boot sources,
	- "images" = delete `output/images` (complete OS images),
	- "debs" = delete packages in `output/debs` for current branch and device family,
	- "alldebs" = delete all packages in `output/debs`,
	- "cache" = delete `output/cache` (rootfs cache),
	- "sources" = delete `sources` (all downloaded sources),
	- "extras" = delete additional packages for current release in `output/debs/extra`
- **KERNEL\_KEEP\_CONFIG** (yes&#124;no):
    - set to "yes" to use kernel config file from previous compilation for the same branch, device family and version
    - set to "no" to use default or user-provided config file
- **BUILD_DESKTOP** (yes&#124;no):
    - set to "yes" to build image with minimal desktop environment
    - set to "no" to build image with console interface only
- **EXTERNAL** (yes&#124;no):
    - set to "yes" to compile and install some extra applications and drivers (only for **default** kernel branch):
        - [USB redirector](http://www.incentivespro.com)
        - Realtek RT8192 wireless driver
        - Mediatek MT7601U wireless - driver
        - Sunxi display control
        - hostapd from sources
- **EXTERNAL_NEW** (no&#124;prebuilt&#124;compile):
	- set to "prebuilt" to install extra applications from repository
	- set to "compile" to compile extra applications in chroot
- **CREATE_PATCHES** (yes&#124;no):
	- set to "yes" will prompt you right before the compilation starts to make changes to the source code. Separate for u-boot and kernel. It will also create a patch out of this. If you want that this patch is included in the normal run, you need to copy it to appropriate directory
	- set to "no" compilation will run uninterrupted 
- **FORCE_CHECKOUT** (yes&#124;no):
    - set to "yes" to force overwrite any changed or manually patched kernel, u-boot and other sources
    - set to "no" to keep all changes to sources
- **BUILD_ALL** (yes&#124;no&#124;demo): cycle through all available board and kernel configurations and make images for all combinations

### Hidden options to minimize user input for build automation:
- **BOARD** (string): you can set name of board manually to skip dialog prompt
- **BRANCH** (default&#124;next&#124;dev): you can set kernel and u-boot branch manually to skip dialog prompt; some options may not be available for all devices
- **RELEASE** (wheezy&#124;jessie&#124;trusty&#124;xenial): you can set OS release manually to skip dialog prompt; use this option with `KERNEL_ONLY=yes` to create board support package

### Hidden options for advanced users (default values are marked **bold**):
- **USE_CCACHE** (**yes**&#124;no): use a C compiler cache to speed up the build process
- **PRIVATE_CCACHE** (yes&#124;**no**) use `$DEST/ccache` as ccache home directory
- **PROGRESS_DISPLAY** (none&#124;plain&#124;**dialog**): way to display output of verbose processes - compilation, packaging, debootstrap
- **PROGRESS_LOG_TO_FILE** (yes&#124;**no**): duplicate output, affected by previous option, to log files `output/debug/*.log`
- **USE_MAINLINE_GOOGLE_MIRROR** (yes&#124;**no**): use `googlesource.com` mirror for downloading mainline kernel sources, may be faster than `git.kernel.org` depending on your location
- **USE_GITHUB_UBOOT_MIRROR** (yes&#124;**no**): use unofficial Github mirror for downloading mainline u-boot sources, may be faster than `git.denx.de` depending on your location
- **FORCE_USE_RAMDISK** (yes&#124;no): overrides autodetect for using tmpfs in new debootstrap and image creation process
- **FIXED_IMAGE_SIZE** (integer): create image file of this size (in megabytes) instead of minimal
- **COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE** (yes&#124;**no**): create compressed archive with image file and GPG signature for redistribution
- **SEVENZIP** (yes&#124;**no**): create .7z archive with extreme compression ratio instead of .zip
- **ROOTFS_TYPE** (**ext4**&#124;f2fs&#124;btrfs&#124;nfs&#124;fel): create image with different root filesystems instead of default ext4. Requires setting FIXED_IMAGE_SIZE to actual size of your SD card for F2FS and BTRFS
