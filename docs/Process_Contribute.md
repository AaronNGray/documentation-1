# Collaborate on the project #

## How? ##

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project
1. Make one or more well commented and clean commits to the repository. 
1. Perform a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) in github's web interface.

If it is a new feature request, don't start the coding first. Remember to [open an issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to discuss the new feature.
