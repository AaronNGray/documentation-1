- Please note: From a software point of view ODROID C1, C1+ and C0 are (nearly) identical. For Hardware differences between C1 and C1+ and to see how to use USB OTG on the latter please see [here](http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:c1_hardware#c1_has_below_improvements_from_the_original_c1). C0 is a stripped down and more power efficient C1+ that can be battery powered (see here [how to read out battery voltage](http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:c0_read_battery_voltage))
- Comprehensive device information and various tips&tricks can be found in [Hardkernel's wiki](http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:odroid-c1). Please be aware that some of the information does not apply to Armbian (eg. we use a different partition table)
- You can save at least 170mW by cutting power to the internal USB hub (and also all USB devices connected to any of the type A receptacles) using `/sys/class/gpio/gpio4` (see description [here](http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=112&t=23763#p160852)). The same way you have full control over power consumption of a connected host powered USB disk: `umount /mnt/usb && echo 0 >/sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value` and `echo 1 >/sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value && sleep 2 && mount /mnt/usb`
- the red led is a power led while the blue led is custom. Boot stage: as soon as u-boot is loaded the blue led lights solid and when kernel starts this changes to `heartbeat` blinking with default settings. Check `cat /sys/class/leds/*blue*/trigger` for other functionality.
