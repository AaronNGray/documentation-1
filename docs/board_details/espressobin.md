- Flashing to latest u-boot is recommended for better functionality. Download [latest u-boot](https://dl.armbian.com/espressobin/u-boot/), copy files to your FAT USB key, plug it into USB3.0 port and proceed with flashing.
- After flashing is done you need to update environment. Copy/paste [this](https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/master/config/bootscripts/boot-espressobin.cmd) to your terminal and execute `saveenv` proceeded with `reset` to reboot into the updated system.
