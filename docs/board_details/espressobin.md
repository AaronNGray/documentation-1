- Flashing to latest u-boot is recommended for better functionality. Download [latest u-boot](https://dl.armbian.com/espressobin/u-boot/), copy files to your FAT USB key, plug it into USB3.0 port and proceed with flashing.
- After updating your SPI flash with most recent "sd\_and\_usb" u-boot, you can boot from USB or SD card the exact same way
- If you manage to crash your SPI, proceed with [SATA boot recovery](http://wiki.espressobin.net/tiki-index.php?page=Boot+ESPRESSObin+from+SATA+drive)
