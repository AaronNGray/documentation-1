Reasons for moving devices to this section:

- no active software development (mainline u-boot and kernel)
- no support from vendor (hardware samples, documentation, software packages)
- never was sold, only samples in small quantities were available
- hardware design flaws don't allow using these devices without stability issues

Support status:

- images are stable but we don't test updating,
- images are provided with no support,
- most images has frozen kernel and u-boot packages to prevent their upgrades.
